**Bioinformatician | Computational Biologist | Life Sciences Researcher**

- With a unique blend of skills in omics and image data analysis, data science, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, I have honed my expertise in Python and R programming languages.

- My journey in bioinformatics has been marked by the development of robust informatics solutions. These solutions have enabled translational genomics initiatives through meticulous data curation, ingestion, harmonization of omics data, and pipeline development.

- Over 13 years of research, I have delved into in vitro, in vivo, data science, and bioinformatics projects. These projects spanned a range of areas including pre-eclampsia, skeletal muscle wasting diseases, and the role of mitochondria and metabolism in stress. I have also explored the pharmacological aspects of Diabetes, CNS, and Cardiovascular complications, alongside therapeutic discoveries including stem cell therapy.

- My expertise spans a broad range of areas including the processing of samples for RNA-seq and LC-MS label-free proteomics, conducting bioinformatic analyses of diverse omics data, the development of robust analysis and curation pipelines, and conducting animal research inclusive of surgical procedures.

- I have honed my machine learning and data analysis skills related to Omics/scientific data. This includes data mining from repositories (NCBI, GEO, TCGA, etc.), data preprocessing, mapping with databases, data visualization (ggplot, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, deep learning, etc.), differential expression (DESeq2, edgeR, t-test, ANOVA, multiple testing, etc.), factor regression analysis, annotation, biological interpretation, unsupervised (clustering techniques like kmeans, hierarchical, etc.) and supervised (SVM, random forest, XGBoost, deep learning) classifications. I am proficient in analyzing various omics data including transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics (mutability analysis), metagenomics, etc. Additionally, I can effectively use computer vision for image classification.

- My communication skills are reflected in my [20 publications in peer-reviewed journals and award-winning conference presentations at regional and international levels](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fZFTqlgAAAAJ&hl=en). I am a team player with a knack for independent, fast-paced self-learning and didactic skills.

I am open to discussing roles/opportunities in the fields of Bioinformatics, Omics Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Life Sciences, Data Science, Computer Vision, or a combination of these.
