I am a life sciences researcher with a useful amalgamation of skills pertaining to in vitro and in vivo wet lab research, omics and image data analysis, data science, data visualization, machine learning, deep learning and computer vision applications involving Python and R programming languages.

I am currently working on in vitro, in vivo, data science and bioinformatics projects related to pre-eclampsia, skeletal muscle wasting diseases, and the role of mitochondria and metabolism in stress. In the span of 10 years of research experience, I worked in the pharmacological aspects of Diabetes, CNS and Cardiovascular complications, in conjunction with therapeutic discoveries including stem cell therapy. My repertoire of skills include sample processing for RNA-seq and LC-MS label-free proteomics and bioinformatic analysis of the data; major in vivo surgeries in rodents such as telemetry and hind-limb ischemia; molecular pharmacology techniques like western blotting, PCR, isolation and purification of mitochondrial-derived vesicles, and enzymatic assays; cell culture; behavioral studies such as Morris water maze; etc.

My written and oral communication skills are evident from my publications in the peer-reviewed journals and award-winning conference presentations at regional and international level. I am a team player with independent fast-paced self-teaching capability with didactic skills.

I am open to discuss the roles/opportunities you may have in the fields of Life Sciences, Data Science, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Cloud Computing (AWS/Azure), or a combination of these.
